## Email Implementation Approach

**Recommended Simple Solution:**

1. Use Next.js API routes with nodemailer
2. Create a basic HTML email template using template literals
3. Configure SMTP settings (Gmail, Outlook, or hosting provider SMTP)
4. Format quote requests into readable email format
5. No external templating libraries needed - just string interpolation

**Email Flow:**

1. User submits quote form
2. API validates form data
3. Sends formatted email to business owner
4. Sends confirmation email to customer
5. Returns success/error response to frontend

## Priority Order

1. Hero Section & Navigation (immediate visual impact)
2. Services Section (core business offering)
3. Contact/Quote Form (lead generation)
4. Email functionality (business critical)
5. Gallery & About sections (trust building)
6. Responsive design & polish
